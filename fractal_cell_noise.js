octavia noise

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this is the heart of the cellular noise algorithm. it's a single x, y lookup. the noise loops on itself, and is a rectangle xsize by ysize. x and y are the current point in space we are calculating for (floating point is fine). the space is divided into squares. n points are deterministically placed             
+---------+ in the square ("samples" controls this). each is given a random 
|   x     | height, by default -1 to 1. a soft 0-1 kernel is centered on each. 
|         | it has a diameter equal to the square size, outside of which it 
|x     x  | falls off cleanly to 0. 
|  x      | 
+---------+ d is density- at density 1 you have 1 square for the entire texture space. at density 2 it's 2 squares by 2, etc.. seed is the seed for this octave. softness alters the shape of the falloff (but it always has the same diameter). the heights can be customized customized by setting the bias value (center) and range (it goes from bias - range to bias + range)   */

positional random number generation

for 2d value noise, we need to be able to input two coordinates and a seed, and
get a deterministic value for that point in space. you can substitute other
approaches for this one- this is a relatively simple, readable approach i came
up with but there are more cryptographically sound 3 input hashes out there.

note that if generalizing this for n dimensions, you'd want your number of dimensions plus one for the seed
